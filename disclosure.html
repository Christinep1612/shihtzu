          <h3><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></em></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you for your interest in IbelieveinShihtzu.com</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I Believe in Shih Tzu was created out of love for my 3 rescued Shih Tzus and my passion for dog training. With this blog, my goal is to not only share my passion with others, but to also create a platform where pet owners, training professionals, and pet product companies can come together with the singular goal of   fostering positive human-canine relationships. In addition to being a proud dog mommy, I am an accomplished small dog pet trainer, Canine Good Citizen evaluator, and pet photographer.  I only use positive reinforcement methods and do not believe in the use of e-collars, prong collars, or any other device which inflicts force, pain, or fear upon a dog while training.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Along the way, I will share stories and musings about my whole four-footed family. In addition to the 3 Shih Tzus, I am the proud mommy of Kyra, a Norwegian Elkhound mix adopted from Best Friends of Las Vegas; Daisy, an energetic Boston Terrier; and Sunny, a rescued snow dog of origins unknown. I also am owned by two loving cats – Ninja and Baby Kitty.</p>

          <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guidelines</span></em></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I believe integrity and honesty is essential to create lasting relationships. As such, I will only promote or provide advertising opportunities to those products and services that I would use with my own dogs.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">As a positive reinforcement trainer I will not accept advertising opportunities with companies that promote, manufacture, or sell items such as e-collars, prong collars, or any other device which inflicts force, pain, or fear upon a dog while training.  Also, when comes to pet edibles, I well on promote products that are either manufactured in the USA or otherwise have impeccable credentials for quality and food safety standards.</p>

          <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Promotional Opportunities</span></em></h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I Believe in Shih Tzu is a young but rapidly growing pet blog. I limit the number of promotional opportunities per month.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Product Reviews:</b></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">We are always looking for the next best thing – from posh to practical – to improve the lives of our fur kids.  That includes items we can use to motivate our dogs for training, toys, tugs, balls, travel gear, and 100% natural treats. With a wide range of dogs from 10 to 55 pounds, we can put your product to the test. Every review will include an in-depth write-up, original pictures, an honest evaluation of the product, and promotion across all of social media platforms.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sponsor a Giveaway:</b></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Isn’t it always great to win something for your best friend? We think so!
