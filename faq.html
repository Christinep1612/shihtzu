		<h3> 1. Should I socialize my puppy at the dog park?</h3>
			<p> No. Puppies are very susceptible to illness even after a full round of vaccinations. We suggest finding puppy parties, or asking your vet for a trusted trainer with off leash puppy classes.</p>
		<h3> 2.  What is the best way to potty train a puppy? Should I use puppy pads? </h3>
			<p> Positive reinforcement is the best way to train any behavior. Be sure to create a schedule for your puppy. This means taking them outside to potty when they wake up, before and after meals, and especially after play. If you are unable to take them out, place them in an area with several puppy pads that is sectioned off from other parts of the house. You want to keep them in an area in which they have potty close by, and it keeps them out of trouble.</p>
		<h3> 3. My puppy hasn't finished his vaccinations yet, should I wait to enroll him in puppy classes?</h3>
			<p>This is a big debate. As a former trainer, I suggest the first set of shots and finding a trainer with off leash puppy classes. Ask them about their disinfection practices before and after classes along with any known cases of Parvo from any of their clients. There is a small timeline for great puppy socialization, you don't want to miss it.</p>
		<h3> 4. How do I find the right dog trainer in my area, there are so many!</h3>
			<p>Finding a qualified individual can be tough. Ask friends for recommendations, you can also contact the Association of Pet Dog Trainers.</p>
