           <p class="intro">Taking care of Shih Tzus can become a little crazy at times. From knowing the best foods to feed, to the comfiest beds and the perfect shampoo to keep their locks shiney and silky can be a daunting task. With the many different brands on the market today, we have compiled our latest finds of the week. </p>

                <p>Goats milk for dogs? Yes! And if you are looking for a healthy "milkshake" to feed to your dog and something that you can enjoy also, then we have just the thing for you.</p>

                <p>So why goats milk and not regular cows milk? Well it seems that goat's milk is a lot healthier for us and our pups.&nbsp;According to the Journal of American Medicine,&nbsp;<span class="style4">“Goat milk is the most complete food known.”</span>&nbsp;It contains vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, trace elements, enzymes, protein, and fatty acids. In fact, the body can digest goat’s milk in 20 minutes.</p>

                <p>Also goats milk is easier to digest as cows milk contains alpha-s1-casein protein. This protein may play a critical role in people and pets being allergic or sensitive to regular cows milk as goats milk may have little or no amount of &nbsp;this protein. In addition, raw goats milk, such as <a title="Primal Pet Food Raw Goat Milk" href="http://www.primalpetfoods.com/product/detail/c/16/id/66" target="_blank">Primal Pet Food Raw Goat Milk</a>&nbsp;(pets only) is high in the enzyme lactase, which allows the breakdown of lactose, a milk sugar . Pasteurization and heat destroy this precious enzyme making it hard for people and dogs to digest regular milk easily. Please note though that if you are unable to purchase raw goats milk, the pasteurized commercial goats milk (as seen in the pic below) still has less lactose than cows milk, and easier for dogs to digest.</p>

                <p>For this recipe I used ingredients from my local Whole Foods Market so we could both enjoy the shake. When purchasing products I try to purchase from those items that are produced locally. Ideally within 150 mile range, but sometimes that is not always possible. The milk is from Summer Hill Goat Dairy that is within a&nbsp;50 miles from me&nbsp;and Redwood Hill Farms produced the yogurt which is about 24o miles from us, but still in California.<p>

                <h2>Shih Tzu Style</h2>

                <p><center><img src="http://www.ohmyshihtzu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AstoriaOvercoat.png" alt="Astoria Overcoat Shih Tzu Product Review" width="300" height="225"></center></p>

                <p>I can't believe that it's February, let alone the fact that winter is almost here (officially). The rain has finally arrived making the mornings a little crazy as you can barely see down the street thanks to the thick Tule fog! It is at this time of the day that the girls and I usually head out on our walks, but just like exercise is a necessity for a happy healthy life, so is lookin' good! I like to keep the girls comfortable on our walks so I needed to find a jacket that was both light weight and added great protection from the wet (foggy) and cold (evenings) weather. So the great folks at <a title="Gold Paw Series Astoria Overcoat" href="http://www.goldpawseries.com/product/astoria-overcoat/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gold Paw Series</a> sent me an Astoria Overcoat to try.</p>

                <p>The Astoria Overcoat is a favorite of the Shih Tzus, not only for its comfort, but it is also very stylish. I don't know about you, but in the mornings when I bring out the harnesses to leash everyone up they all go crazy. But this coat has a d-ring leash attachment. Everyone thought I was just getting Katie dressed but I was able to slip out the door and attach the leash once we were out of the line of sight of everyone. At first I was a little hesitant just to use the d-ring, but the coat was very secure on her, which I loved.</p>

                <p>To buy or learn more about the Astoria Overcoat, check out<a title="Gold Paw Series - Astoria Overcoat" href="http://www.goldpawseries.com/product/astoria-overcoat/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Gold Paw Series</a>. Gold Paw Series also has a great <a title="Gold Paw Series - Fit Guide" href="http://youtu.be/apecJ3O8ryw" target="_blank">video Fit Guide on measuring</a> your Shih Tzu for a proper fit of their clothing line.</p>

                <p>Katie the Shih Tzu (model) , who is approximately 14 pounds, slim and normally wears a baggy medium in off the shelf wear,&nbsp; wore&nbsp; a size 14 comfortably, allowing for layering of fleece or other clothing underneath. Riley would definitely need a size 16 as she weighs in at 18 pounds and is a bit of a bigger girl with an athletic build.</p>

                <p>So if you are looking for a nice winter/spring coat that you are able to easily layer with fleece, I would totally recommend the Astoria Overcoat!</p>

                <h2>Trixie's Weight Loss</h2>

                <img src="http://www.ohmyshihtzu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Weightloss3.png" alt="3 Benefits of WeightLoss for Shih Tzus: Trixies Triumph" height="250" width="300"></a>

                <p>Have you grown accustomed to seeing your pet a little plump? It’s scary thought of change sometimes. Since having Trixie for the last three years she’s always been a little overweight. But currently she is trying a new weight loss supplement and with it she’s losing weight. But I am finding out that the same triumphs and benefits that I am experiencing losing weight (15 pounds in 3 months) she is experiencing also!</p>

                <h2>Weight Loss Benefits for Shih Tzu's (Trixies List)</h2>
                <p>We experienced serveral benefits for Trixie including the ability to exercise without exhaustion, increased energy, and her clothes even began fitting her better.</p>
                    
                <p>The only thing that is a little different in her case is that when I look at her I no longer see the chubbiness... and that change is a little scary, she is no longer the little chunk of chubbiness that I am used. She is beginning to have that cute little waistline like all the other Shih Tzus in our house. </p>

                <p>So lets talk about some of these benefits we are experiencing with her weight-loss</p>
              <h2>Exercising Without Exhaustion</h2>
                <p>There was a time that Trixie could not walk around the block. Heck, she could barely make it to the corner of our block. The huffing and puffing was so bad that I would take the dog stroller with us because it was just too much for her. But the weight loss has changed all that. Now our walks consist of 20 minutes and 3/4 of a mile in the mornings! The huffing and puffing has disappeared, she keeps a great pace on her own, and we no longer take the stroller with us!</p>

                <img src="http://www.ohmyshihtzu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Trixie-Walk.png" alt="3 Beneifts of Weight Loss for Shih Tzus: Trixies Triumph" height="250" width="300">
              <h2>Increased energy</h2>
                <p>With the walks in the morning we also have increased energy when we get back home! The harness comes off and off she goes tearing through the house at lightning speed! Actually she is always running around the house, in the backyard, even jumping on and off the furniture, something she never used to do. She has also learned to use a set of little stairs to help them onto the furniture.</p>
